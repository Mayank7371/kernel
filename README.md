# Kernel - A Simple OS Kernel Project

Welcome to **Kernel** — a bare-metal, from-scratch kernel built for learning, exploration, and absolute domination over the hardware.

This project is handcrafted in low-level languages (Assembly + C), bootstrapped at `0x7C00`, and loaded with knowledge bombs for aspiring OS developers.
